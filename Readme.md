### Budget Tracker

This app helps you to track your expentures and income in easy manner and it will help you to achive your financial goals because you know where your money is going and why. For people who want to eliminate all of their credit card debt, having a budget can give you a workable plan to pay it off. If you want to take a vacation next year to Hawaii, your monthly budget will help you see where the money will come from, how long it will take to save for it, and how you can adjust other expenses to make it happen. Without a budget, you may just have an idea in your head of what you want, but with the budget, you now have something on paper (or electronically in this day and age) you can look at to guide you along the way.
